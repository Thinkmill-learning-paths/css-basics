# CSS basics

## Step 6 - Animations

### Let's go for a trip around the moon

Style the HTML below to re-create the following: 

<img src="/assets/rotate.gif" width="250px" alt="Showing The span flying in a circular orbit">

Then animate the rocket (`/assets/rotate.gif`) to show it flying in a circular orbit.

Rules: 
* Do not rotate the rocket itself, or the people will fall out of it.

```html
<div class="rotate-me">
  <span class="whee">ðŸš€</span>
</div>
```
