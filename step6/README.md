# CSS basics

## Step 6 - Animations

### Let's go for a trip around the moon

Style the HTML below to re-create the following:

<img src="/assets/rotate.gif" width="250px" alt="Showing The span flying in a circular orbit">

Animated the rocket to fly around a circular orbit.

Rules:

- Make sure the rocket keeps up-right, (or people will fall out of it)

```html
<div class="rotate-me">
  <span class="whee">ðŸš€</span>
</div>
```
